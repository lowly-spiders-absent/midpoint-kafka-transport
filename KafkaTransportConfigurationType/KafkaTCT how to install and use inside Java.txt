To install custom schema extension, which KafkaTCT is,
the schema (.xsd) files (in our case - file)
have to be placed in the schema subdirectory
of midpoint.home directory
a somewhat useful explanation here: https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/schema/custom-schema-extension/#installing-custom-schema-extension
(Installing Custom Schema Extension section)

To use KafkaTCT in Java, we can't simply
import it (like 
in https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint 
    in https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/37b8b510c0dd318b9638be289cb78e586ad9ff14/model/notifications-impl/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/transport/impl/TransportServiceImpl.java
        ,for example) (I might be wrong about this one, though).
In order to use KafkaTCT, we can try and load local .xsd file
a somewhat useful example here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63946616/java-load-local-xsd-file-in-import-namespace
